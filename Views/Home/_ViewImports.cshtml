    this filename is fixed, must be exact to work
    the order of execution is:
    _ViewImports.cshtml
    _ViewStart.cshtml
    View...
    LayoutView
    so the point is ViewImports will run before any view is executed,
    so this can be used to import any usage statements that will be common
    ammongst the views associated with the controller.
    in this case we import the Models namespace,
    that would otherwise need to be imported in each View file individually
    the _ViewImports file can also be added at the root Views folder,
    which will run before _ViewImports inside controller view folders like Home
    so using _ViewImports there can be two layers of imports,
    first the default viewimports for all views, independent of controller
    next viewimports for specific controller folder, and 
    finally any imports inside the actual view.cshtml file being executed
