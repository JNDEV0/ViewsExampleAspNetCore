    this Layout is not actually used in the project, apart from illustrating multiple layouts sharing a common MasterLayout,
    In this case Layouts can also be nested, that is, a Layout can have its own Layout, that receives the output of the first,
    the same way as a target view points to its Layout that receives the view's output.

    this nesting is not common but is a solution that can be used, for example MasterLayout contains a common navbar, scripts CSS etc
    and the nested layouts vary from the landing page, to the project view, to the reviews, to the contact pages etc,
    each which may have their own specific content that gets passed to the nested layouts and filled into the the target nested layout structure

    here _Layout2 shares a common MasterLayout with _Layout
